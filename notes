Problems:

Optimisations:
    a) `find move` -> when searching for moves, looking through a list instead of a set (use (Set Move) instead of [Move] ?)
    b) `king` and `pawn` parsers -> these two have a dependency on parse-order. This shouldn't be.
    
To Do:
     * 1. Add proper checkmate verification
     * 2. Implement proper rendering for the board
     * 3. Implement a game interface
    4. Implement parsing of game outcomes -- do I need to though?
    5. Add stalemate checks
    6. Add in-game draw suggestions checks
    7. Refine the API
    8. Write a read-me, documentation and release
    9. Add some more tests
