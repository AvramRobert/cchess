Problems:

1. Performance: 
    a) `find move` -> when searching for moves, looking through a list instead of a set (use (Set Move) instead of [Move] ?)

2. Optimisations:
    a) `captureError` et. al     -> I've pushed down every failure to its most local. Find a way to extract better information from the move set and display a better error
    b) `king` and `pawn` parsers -> these two have a dependency on parse-order. This shouldn't be.
