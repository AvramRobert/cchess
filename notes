Problems:

Optimisations:
    a) `find move` -> when searching for moves, looking through a list instead of a set (use (Set Move) instead of [Move] ?)
    b) `captureError` et. al     -> I've pushed down every failure to its most local. Find a way to extract better information from the move set and display a better error
    c) `king` and `pawn` parsers -> these two have a dependency on parse-order. This shouldn't be.
    
To Do:
    1. Add proper checkmate/stalemate checks
    2. Add in-game draw suggestions checks
    3. Implement proper rendering for the board
    4. Implement a game interface
    5. Refine the API
    6. Write a read-me, documentation and release
    7. Add some more tests
