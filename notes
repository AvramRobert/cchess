Problems:

Optimisations:
    a) `find move` -> when searching for moves, looking through a list instead of a set (use (Set Move) instead of [Move] ?)
    b) `king` and `pawn` parsers -> these two have a dependency on parse-order. This shouldn't be.
    
To Do:
    1. Add proper checkmate/stalemate checks
    2. Add in-game draw suggestions checks
    3. Implement proper rendering for the board
    4. Implement a game interface
    5. Implement parsing of game outcomes
    6. Refine the API
    7. Write a read-me, documentation and release
    8. Add some more tests
