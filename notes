Problems:

Optimisations:
    a) `find move` -> when searching for moves, looking through a list instead of a set (use (Set Move) instead of [Move] ?)
    b) `king` and `pawn` parsers -> these two have a dependency on parse-order. This shouldn't be.
    
To Do:
     * 1. Add proper checkmate verification
     * 2. Implement proper rendering for the board
     * 3. Implement a game interface
     * 4. Implement parsing of game outcomes -> never interpret a pre-existing PGN game into a termination
     * 5. Add stalemate checks
     * 6 Fix PGN header parser to account for misshaps in ordering + add the other additional  fields a file might have
     * 7. Implement evaluation steps for a Board
     * 8. Implement all PGN tags
    9. Implement translation from Moves -> PGN (add benchmarks, try to simplify, make into chunks and pop every pair of moves)
   10. Refine the API
   11. Write a read-me, documentation and release
   12. Add some more tests
   13. Complete game interface (print game as PGN file out when exiting or resigning)  
   14. Add an engine to play against
   15. Add in-game draw suggestions checks
   16. Write a PGN parser that parses files directly and doesn't use bytestrings to extract each individual game
