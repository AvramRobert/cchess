Problems:

1. Performance: 
    => Something is slow. Either the API or the Parser. Possible culprits:
        a) `permit`    -> check for every individual move 
         * b) `commit`    -> applied on a list instead of map -> this was apparently a bulk of the performance overhead
        c) `find move` -> when searching for moves, looking through a list instead of a set
        d) `consume`   -> the traversal is expensive because i always have to reverse

    -> keep a separate map for looking up colour and pieces
    
    -> implement a naive version of `time` to pint-point the outliers * NOPE
    -> use `criterion` in the end to test overall Performance
    => the new implementation should be faster than the old

2. Optimisations:
    a) `consume`                 -> If i make follow put things at the beginning instead of the end, I needn't reverse every consumption
    b) `movesPosition`           -> pre-calculate the threats of a move and pass it to every move-function
    c) `captureError` et. al     -> I've pushed down every failure to its most local. Find a way to extract better information from the move set and display a better error
    d) `king` and `pawn` parsers -> these two have a dependency on parse-order. This shouldn't be.
